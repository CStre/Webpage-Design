# Webpage-Design
This displays my work from CS 3548 (Single Page Applications) from Spring 2023 at Appalachian State.


Each file contains the projects and in class assignments we had during this class. I used an angular 
componenet to display the code but all of the files located in source we written by me. This includes 
.ts , .css , and .html files.
